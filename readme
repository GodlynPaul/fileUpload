================================
Requirements 

UI implementation of file upload. 
- Multiple file upload scenario based on user selection 
- No library should be used.
================================
Drawbacks

The code to send the data to the server will fail as the url to hit is url="" base.js(Lineno:32)
.send() function will fail so it will always result in uploading fail.
================================
For best experience 
Browser: Chrome 
Please run the http-server and then access the index.html to view all the functionality.
